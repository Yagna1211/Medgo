## Troubleshooting

### "0 drivers notified" - What's wrong?

**Common Reasons:**
1. **No drivers are online** - Drivers must toggle their status to "ONLINE" to receive alerts
2. **No drivers within 50km** - Try from a different location or call 108
3. **Drivers haven't set their location** - Drivers must allow location access
4. **Consent not given** - You must check the consent box

**For Drivers:**
- Make sure you're **ONLINE** (green badge at top)
- Check that **location permission** is granted
- Your location updates automatically when you toggle online

**For Patients:**
- Make sure you checked the **consent checkbox**
- Verify your **location was detected** (shows on map)
- Check that you filled in **all required fields**

### SMS Not Received?

**For Drivers:**
- Verify your **phone number** is correct in your profile
- Check your phone's **message inbox** (not spam)
- SMS delivery depends on the Fast2SMS API status

**Note:** Even if SMS fails, you'll still receive **in-app notifications** on your dashboard when online.

## Privacy & Security

- SMS messages contain anonymized information
- Direct patient phone numbers are NOT shared in SMS
